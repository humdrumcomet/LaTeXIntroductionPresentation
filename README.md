# LaTeX Advanced Workshop

Welcome to the beamer repo for the advanced LaTeX workshop.

As in the previous workshop (available [here](https://github.com/humdrumcomet/LaTeXCodingSession)) all the code used to prepare the document and the presentation are available in this github repo.

## Overview and Usage
This tutorial document is designed to be used in Overleaf, but will work with any current version of TeXlive (Linux or Mac), MacTeX (Mac), or MikTeX (Windows). 
If you are compiling this document outside of Overleaf, please note that the minted package has an external dependency of [Pygments](https://pygments.org/), but Pygments is multiplatform and will work with Windows, Mac, or Linux.

This document demonstrates how to prepare a slide deck in beamer and its integration with the LaTeX abilities we've already discussed.

#### Compilation
In the presentation version I make use of my own images, but in the version available on the main branch of the Github repo the images have been replaced with dummy images. 
This means that it will compile regardless of what machine it is being complied on but you will notice it is different from the one I was using in the presentation.
