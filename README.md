## Overview and Usage
This tutorial document is designed to be used in Overleaf, but will work with any current version of TeXlive (Linux or Mac), MacTeX (Mac), or MikTeX (Windows). 
If you are compiling this document outside of Overleaf, please note that the minted package has an external dependency of [Pygments](https://pygments.org/).
Pygments is multiplatform and will work with Windows, Mac, or Linux.

This slide deck introduces and motivates document preparation with the typesetting tool LaTeX.

#### Compilation
To compile the presentation itself, LuaLaTeX is required.
Usage of arara is preferred and the .tex file already contains arara directives.
